# Square-Wars-One
This is a proof of concept using Unity.


Square Wars is a 2D, top down, multiplayer shooter.

Each player controls a square which can move in four directions (up, down, left and right) and shoots in all four directions.

The aim of the game is to reach the winners square on each map. This will usually require you to defeat your opponents to unlock the path to it.

The player that reaches a certain number of map wins first wins the game.
